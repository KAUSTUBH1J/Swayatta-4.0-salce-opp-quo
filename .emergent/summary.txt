The AI engineer successfully progressed the Sawayatta ERP, transitioning from initial backend setup of the Lead Management Module to substantial frontend development and complex feature integration. The work began by completing backend CRUD for Product Services and Sub-Tender Types, ensuring proper master data initialization after fixing a  bug. Subsequently, a multi-stage LeadForm was developed, addressing  warnings and submission issues related to a mandatory checklist. The Lead Listing page with KPIs was implemented and debugged for data format mismatches. Most recently, a sophisticated Lead Change Status modal was built, featuring conditional UI for Convert to Opportunity, robust API integration, and seamless inclusion into the . The current focus has shifted to the ambitious Opportunity Management Module, with initial backend models and APIs for core masters and opportunities already integrated.

The Sawayatta ERP is a full-stack system for managing business operations. Initially, the core problem involved fixing a broken authentication, dynamic sidebar, and RBAC-controlled UI elements on the frontend. After stabilization, two major modules were developed: Company Registration and Contact Management, both requiring comprehensive full-stack CRUD, multi-step forms, and advanced features like AI duplicate detection. The project is currently focused on the Lead Management Module and the new Opportunity Management Module.

**Lead Management Module**:
*   Comprehensive module for Sales with Partner Master, Product & Services Master, Sub-Tender Master.
*   Multi-stage lead form (General Info, Lead Details, Proofs & Checklist) with tender logic, validations (Lead ID, conditional fields), nurture/conversion logic, notifications, audit trail.
*   Lead Listing page with KPIs (total, pending, approved, escalated), filters, search, and full CRUD.
*   A Lead Change Status modal: allows status changes (approved, rejected, convert_to_opp). Convert to Opportunity option only appears after a lead is approved. Creates an Opportunity via  if  is selected.
*   Addition of  field to Lead form, conditionally displayed based on  (Tender or Pre-Tender) with Prepaid and Postpaid options.

**Opportunity Management Module**:
*   Supports an L1→L8 pipeline, multi-quotation flow, rate-card pricing, purchase-cost-driven P&L, multi-phase quotations (phases→groups→items), KPIs, RBAC, and audit logs.
*   Listing page with KPIs and weighted revenue.
*   Quotation system with profitability percentage calculation and colored badges.
*   Integration with existing Lead Management. The work for this module is currently in its initial backend setup phase.

-   :
    *   **Importance**: Central FastAPI application defining Pydantic models, CRUD APIs, RBAC logic, and database initialization ().
    *   **Changes**:
        *   Added CRUD APIs for  and  to enable frontend management (later UI removed).
        *   Refactored  to correctly initialize Lead Management master data (Product Services, Sub-Tender Types) by creating  and ensuring it runs independently of  collection status. Removed duplicate initialization from .
        *   Temporary debug endpoints were added and removed for master data initialization.
        *   Fixed  function (KeyError: 'module_id') to correctly derive  from  data in role permissions.
        *   Added  POST endpoint for changing lead status and conditionally converting to opportunity.
        *   Updated Lead models (, , ) to include  with / options and pattern validation.
        *   Added initial backend models and API endpoints for Opportunity Management core masters (e.g., , , , , ) and  model, along with their CRUD APIs and initialization in .

-   :
    *   **Importance**: Manages global routing () and context providers.
    *   **Changes**:
        *   Added imports and routes for  and  (later removed).

        *   Improved form submission logic and user feedback, particularly for the mandatory 5-item checklist in Step 3, with clear warnings and button state changes.
        *   Added  dropdown to Step 1, conditionally displayed when  is Tender or Pre-Tender, with Prepaid and Postpaid options and corresponding validation.

-   :
    *   **Importance**: Displays lead data, including KPIs, search, filter, pagination, and actions.
    *   **Changes**:
        *   Implemented the main component for the Lead Listing page.
        *   Fixed KPI display issue: adjusted frontend expectations to match backend API response field names (e.g.,  instead of ).
        *   Integrated  button into the action column via 's new  prop.

-   :
    *   **Importance**: New component for managing lead status changes.
    *   **Changes**: Created from scratch to allow users to approve, reject, or convert a lead to an opportunity. Includes conditional display of Convert to Opportunity option after approval, and UI for lead preview, dropdown, and action buttons.

-   :
