<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built the Sawayatta ERP system incrementally. Starting from an initial React/FastAPI/MongoDB setup, JWT authentication was implemented, overcoming early challenges like syntax errors and MongoDB ObjectId serialization. The core User Management module was then developed with full CRUD, rich UI components, and validation. Subsequent iterations focused on fixing backend update logic and refining frontend data display. The most significant development involved implementing a comprehensive RBAC system, including a dynamic sidebar, permission enforcement on all CRUD operations, and an advanced Role-Permission Matrix UI. The engineer meticulously addressed reported bugs and performed extensive testing after each major phase. Currently, the system is mostly functional, but the engineer is debugging a frontend issue where the login UI gets stuck, and permission fetching sometimes results in 403 errors, despite the backend logic appearing correct. The focus is on refining the frontend's authentication and permission loading sequence.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a full-stack ERP named Sawayatta ERP.
**Core Features & Status**:
*   **Authentication & RBAC**: JWT username/password login, Sawayatta ERP branding. Implemented with an admin user, secure login/logout. Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system (Users → Roles → Permissions) with granular , , , ,  permissions.
*   **User Management Module**: All 9 masters (Users, Roles, Permissions, Modules, Menu, Role-Permission Mapping, Departments, Designations, Activity Logs) implemented with CRUD, , audit fields, soft delete (except Activity Logs). Frontend features: modal forms, Zod validation (red error messages), pagination, search, sorting, CSV export, action columns (View, Edit, Delete).
*   **Dynamic RBAC Sidebar**: Dynamically built from backend  endpoint. Sidebar only shows modules and menus accessible to the user's role (requiring  permission), supports expand/collapse, and enforces 403 Forbidden for unauthorized routes.
*   **Role-Permission UI**: Implemented as a matrix interface with role tabs, checkboxes for permissions (View, Add, Edit, Delete, Export) per menu, expand/collapse modules, Add Module flow for unassigned modules, and batch save.
*   **Permission-driven UI/API**: Action buttons (Add, Edit, Delete, Export) on list pages and rows dynamically show/hide based on user's permissions, with backend API enforcing the same.
*   **API (REST Endpoints)**: Auth endpoints (, ), User Management masters, , . All backend API routes prefixed with .
*   **Security**: Passwords hashed with bcrypt. RBAC middleware checks permissions on every API call. Activity logging implemented.
*   **Sales Module**: Defined but not yet implemented.

<code_architecture>

-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This file defines all database models (User, Role, Permission, Module, Menu, etc.) using Pydantic. It includes authentication endpoints, CRUD APIs for all 9 User Management modules, RBAC middleware for permission checks, dynamic sidebar API (), and export APIs. Key changes include: fixing MongoDB ObjectId serialization, integrating  and JWT, implementing comprehensive RBAC middleware with  helpers, refactoring CRUD update operations to exclude auto-generated fields (uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), ), adding a  field to the  model, and creating a startup function to seed initial RBAC data.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Contains  and .  was added to enable JWT authentication.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The central React component managing application routing. It orchestrates the integration of the login page, dashboard layout, , and . It defines routes for all main pages, including the 403 Forbidden page. It was updated to integrate all user management modules and dynamically render the sidebar based on RBAC.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Users.js, Roles.js, Departments.js, Designations.js, Permissions.js, Modules.js, Menus.js, ActivityLogs.js**: These components represent the UI for each User Management master. They feature modal forms with Zod validation, integrate with backend APIs for CRUD operations, and utilize the  and  for permission-aware interactions. The  component was updated to include the code field.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/DynamicSidebar.js**: A new component that fetches the RBAC-filtered navigation structure from the  endpoint and renders an interactive, expandable/collapsible sidebar.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/ForbiddenPage.js**: A newly created component to display a 403 Forbidden message for unauthorized route access.
-   **/app/frontend/src/contexts/PermissionContext.js**: A new React Context designed to manage and distribute user permissions across the application. It is responsible for fetching and holding the authenticated user's permissions, enabling child components to check access rights using functions like , , etc.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/ProtectedButton.js**: A new reusable component that conditionally renders its children (typically a Shadcn ) based on the permissions provided, ensuring UI elements align with user access rights.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/PermissionDataTable.js**: A generic DataTable component that was introduced to display master data. It enhances basic table functionality by dynamically showing/hiding action buttons (View, Edit, Delete, Export) based on the user's specific permissions, integrating with .
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/RolePermissionMatrix.js**: A newly developed, sophisticated UI component that replaces the simpler . It presents a matrix-style interface for managing role-permission mappings, featuring role tabs, checkboxes for individual permissions (View, Add, Edit, Delete, Export) per menu, module expand/collapse, an Add Module flow for unassigned modules, and a batch save mechanism.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement forgot password functionality via email.
- Implement file upload storage to the local filesystem for documents.
- Develop the full Sales Module, including Company, Contact, Channel Partner, Lead, and Opportunity masters with multi-step forms and CSV export.
- Implement rate-limiting for login attempts and account locking after N failures.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently debugging an issue where the frontend login process visually appears stuck on Signing in... and the dynamic sidebar menus are not visible after login. This persists despite the backend  endpoint successfully returning the correct, permission-filtered navigation data and the initial login API call () also succeeding. Backend logs indicate that some subsequent requests, particularly to , are returning 403 Forbidden errors. The suspicion is a timing issue in the frontend's authentication flow, specifically within , where it might be attempting to fetch permissions before the user's authentication token is fully set and recognized, leading to unauthorized access attempts and a UI hang.

<optional_next_step>
Update  to ensure permissions are fetched only after successful user authentication.
