The AI engineer successfully progressed the Sawayatta ERP project through several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the existing application by resolving fundamental frontend issues, specifically the broken authentication flow, incorrect  configurations, and non-functional permission-based UI elements. This involved iterative debugging, including leveraging the  and  to diagnose complex  and environmental issues. Post-stabilization, two major modules were developed: Company Registration and Contact Management. Both entailed comprehensive full-stack developmentâ€”defining backend models and APIs with RBAC, and building responsive, multi-step frontend forms and listing pages with advanced features like AI duplicate detection and SPOC enforcement. The project is currently in the initial backend development phase of the Lead Management Module. The approach was highly iterative, with frequent testing and direct issue resolution as identified by testing agents.

The Sawayatta ERP is a full-stack system (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) with JWT authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The initial problem involved a broken frontend: non-functional login, uninitialized sidebar, non-submitting CRUD forms, and missing permission-based UI buttons (Add/Edit/Delete/Export). The immediate fix involved correcting frontend authentication (JWT storage, Axios headers), enabling dynamic sidebar loading, and fixing CRUD forms for user management, followed by correctly integrating  for RBAC-driven UI buttons across master pages.

Subsequently, the following modules were requested:
1.  **Company Registration Module**: A multi-step form (General Info, Location, Financials, Documents, Checklist) with client/server-side validation (unique name, conditional fields for GST/PAN/VAT), lead scoring, auto-save, notifications, audit trail, and bulk import/export. A comprehensive listing page with full CRUD was also required.
2.  **Contact Management Module**: A multi-stage form (General Info, Contact Details, Additional Info) with validations for email/SPOC uniqueness, AI-based duplicate detection (fuzzy match), RBAC, and a master listing page supporting full CRUD, search, filter, sort, pagination, and bulk actions.
3.  **Lead Management Module**: A comprehensive module for Sales with Partner Master, Product & Services Master, Sub-Tender Master, and KPIs. It includes a multi-stage lead form (General Info, Lead Details, Proofs & Checklist) with tender logic, various validations (Lead ID format, conditional fields), nurture/conversion logic, notifications, audit trail, and a Lead Listing page with KPIs (total, pending, approved, escalated), filters, search, and full CRUD.

<code_architecture>

-   : This central FastAPI file defines all Pydantic models (User, Role, Company, Contact, Lead, Partner, ProductService, SubTenderType), CRUD API endpoints, RBAC logic, and database initialization. It underwent continuous modification to integrate new modules and fix routing/validation issues.
-   : Configures backend-specific environment variables for MongoDB connection and JWT secret.
-   : The main React component managing global routing (), context providers (Auth, Permission), and layout. It was updated to include routes for new modules like Company Registration, Company List, Contact Form, and Contact List.
-   : Stores frontend environment variables, primarily , which was a recurring fix point to ensure proper API routing in the Kubernetes environment.
-   : Handles user CRUD. Fixes involved  component integration with  and conditional password validation in edit mode.
-   : A reusable component providing a data table with RBAC-controlled Add/Edit/Delete/Export buttons. Its correct usage was vital for consistent UI.
-   , , : Modified to correctly utilize  and fix  component form integration.
-   : Created for the multi-step company registration form, supporting create/edit and auto-save.
-   : Created for displaying company data with CRUD, search, filter, pagination, and export capabilities.
-   : Created for the multi-step contact registration form.
-   : Created for displaying contact data, fixed for  empty string values.
